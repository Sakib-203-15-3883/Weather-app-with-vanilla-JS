 A list of javaScript topics that are used in This weather app
 
1. Asynchronous Programming:

Handling asynchronous operations, such as API requests, async/await to ensure smooth execution without blocking the main thread.
Using async/await to wait for the API response before processing and displaying the weather data.

2. API Integration:

Fetching weather data from a weather API using the fetch() function and making API requests with appropriate parameters.
Fetching weather data from OpenWeatherMap API by sending HTTP requests with the city name and API key.

3. Event Handling:

Capturing user interactions, such as button clicks or form submissions, and triggering appropriate actions or functions.
Adding a click event listener to the search button to initiate the weather data retrieval based on the user's input.

4. Conditional Statements: 

Using if/else or switch statements to evaluate conditions and make decisions based on different weather conditions.
Displaying different weather icons based on the weather condition returned by the API response.

5. Error Handling:

Handling potential errors or failed API requests, and providing appropriate error messages or fallback behavior.
Checking the response status and displaying an error message if the requested city is not found.

6. Data Formatting:

Manipulating and formatting retrieved data to present it in a user-friendly manner, such as converting temperature units or formatting timestamps.
Converting the temperature value from Celsius to Fahrenheit or displaying the date and time in a specific format.


7. DOM Manipulation: 

Accessing and updating the Document Object Model (DOM) to dynamically display weather information on the web page.
Updating the HTML content of specific elements to display the city name, temperature, humidity, and wind speed.
